/**
 * How every collection is owned, for the purposes of answering a data-subject
 * request.
 *
 * ## Why this exists as a declaration rather than a query
 *
 * GDPR Art. 15 and 20 require handing someone everything we hold about them,
 * and Art. 17 requires destroying it. Both fail the same way and fail silently:
 * a collection nobody remembered. The export looks complete, the deletion
 * reports success, and the data is still there.
 *
 * So ownership is declared per collection, EXHAUSTIVELY, and a test cross-checks
 * this list against the DDL schema in `scripts/couchbase-schema.ts`. Adding a
 * collection there without classifying it here fails that test. The point is
 * not that this list is right today — it is that it cannot quietly go wrong.
 *
 * ## The three spellings
 *
 * ADR-0004 recorded that tenancy is a field with three spellings, and that is
 * still true: `userId` nearly everywhere, `user_id` in `credentials_profiles`,
 * and `sellerId` across `reports_*`. Rather than a migration to unify them —
 * which would touch every read in the app — the difference is captured here,
 * where it is needed exactly once.
