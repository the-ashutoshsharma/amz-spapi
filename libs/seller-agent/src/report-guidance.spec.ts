/**
 * Guidance that exists because the agent got a real question wrong.
 *
 * A seller asked for three months of payouts to enter into Quicken. The
 * Finances API 403'd, and the agent — correctly diagnosing the missing role —
 * offered two manual workarounds without first checking that the settlement
 * reports were already imported. Once pushed, it found them. It then reported
 * the payouts WITHOUT dates, saying deposit dates "aren't stored in your
 * imported settlement rows".
 *
 * They are stored — but not where anyone looking at a transaction row would
 * find them. Checked against the live account: 17 rows out of 17,496 carry
 * `depositDate`. Amazon writes the deposit date, the settlement window and the
 * net `amountTotal` on ONE totals row per settlement and leaves all four blank
 * on every transaction row beneath it. Grouping transaction rows by
 * depositDate therefore returns almost nothing, which looks exactly like a
 * field that was never imported.
 *
 * The tool description said only "settlement -> amount" and named no
 * groupings, so the model reached for `date` — which follows the
 * per-transaction posted date and scatters one payout across a whole period —
 * and concluded from the mess that the dates did not exist. The fix is to name
 * the measure that selects the totals rows: `amountTotal` grouped by
 * ["settlementId","depositDate"] returns one dated payout per settlement, and
 * summing `amount` over that settlement reproduces the same figure exactly.
 *
 * The cost was not a crash. It was a confident false statement about the
 * seller's own data, plus a instruction to go and redo work by hand. Both
 * halves are pinned here: the field names must stay in the description, and
 * the 403 path must reach for stored rows before it reaches for the user.

 * per-day columns, so daily shipped units is detail rows with
 * eventType "Shipments" totalled by date. Verified against the live account:
 * 2,522 Shipments rows were sitting there the whole time.
 *
