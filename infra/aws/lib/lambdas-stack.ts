 * Every Lambda app in the workspace, deployed the way it asked to be (#53).

 * Two packaging paths, chosen per app by its own declaration rather than by a
 * list kept here:
 *
 *   zip   — an esbuild bundle from `nx build`. No node_modules is shipped;
 *           pnpm's linked layout does not survive packaging, and bundling makes
 *           workspace-dependency resolution a non-issue at runtime.
 *   image — a container built from the Dockerfile the build copied next to that
 *           bundle, for functions with native binaries or model files that
 *           cannot be bundled (ONNX, sharp), and the only way past 250MB
 *           unzipped.
 *
 * Both read the same directory, `dist/apps/lambdas/<name>`, and both identify
 * the deployed artefact by a hash of its contents — the zip through
 * `Code.fromAsset`, the image through `DockerImageCode.fromImageAsset`. That is
 * the whole reason there is no image tag, no version parameter and no push
 * target to keep in step: the template changes when, and only when, the built
 * output changes, which is exactly when CloudFormation must call
 * UpdateFunctionCode. A named tag cannot do this — Lambda resolves a tag to a
 * digest at deploy time and will not revisit it, so re-pushing `:latest` leaves
 * the old code running while the deploy reports success. See ADR-0006.
 *
 * Neither path uses the construct that bundles for you (`NodejsFunction`, or a
 * Dockerfile that compiles TypeScript): those build at synth time, outside Nx,
 * which would stop `nx affected` from governing what is deployed. Nx compiles;
 * CDK only packages what Nx produced.
