/**
 * The declared shape of an environment scope, and the client the scripts share.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for collections and indexes. `couchbase-ddl.ts`
 * converges a scope onto it; `migrate-to-environment-scopes.ts` reads the same list
 * to know what to copy. Adding a collection or an index means editing THIS file and
 * running the DDL tool — nothing else.
 *
 * Env: CB_DATA_API_URL, CB_USERNAME, CB_PASSWORD, CB_BUCKET
 *   npx tsx --env-file=apps/web/.env.local <script>
 *
 * Node reads the file itself (`--env-file`, native since 20.6). Do NOT use
 * `set -a && . apps/web/.env.local`: the shell re-expands the value, so a
 * password containing $, ` or ! arrives truncated or altered, and the only
 * symptom is an authentication failure indistinguishable from a wrong
 * password. One of ours is 18 characters and the shell delivered 8.
 *
 * Uses the Data API rather than the native SDK. That constraint is really about the
 * Vercel runtime and not about scripts (see #56) — the native SDK would be fine here
 * and is already a dependency. Left as HTTP for now so there is one client to reason
 * about; #76 may retire the distinction entirely.
