# Architecture Decision Records

Short records of significant, hard-to-reverse decisions and _why_ we made them.
One decision per file, numbered sequentially. Format: Context → Decision → Options
considered → Consequences. A decision is never edited to reverse it — instead a new
ADR supersedes it, and both link to each other.

Status values: **Proposed** → **Accepted** → **Superseded** (or **Rejected**).

Write one when a choice is expensive to undo, when two reasonable options were
weighed, or when the code will not explain itself later. The test: if someone
finds this decision in six months and asks "why is it like this?", is the answer
in the repository?
