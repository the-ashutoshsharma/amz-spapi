   * of every authenticated request and its single-query shape is worth keeping;
   * this is a separate concern that happens to need the same email. Awaited
   * separately, but only after the gate has already decided — a badge must
   * never be the thing that delays a redirect.

   * Failure is silent by design. A missing badge is a missed notification; an
   * error page because the badge query failed would be a worse outcome than the
   * problem it reports.
