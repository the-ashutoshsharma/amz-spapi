 * Host implementation of read-only Amazon Ads access for the agent (#86).
 *
 * Scoped to a USER rather than a seller, unlike reports. An advertiser profile
 * belongs to an Ads account, and one user commonly holds several — this seller
 * has four (US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil). There is no single "their Ads account"
 * to resolve to, which is why every call carries a `profileId` and why
 * `listProfiles` exists at all.
 *
 * Reads AND writes. The write methods (bids, budgets, states, negative
 * keywords) can spend real money, so their tools carry `needsApproval` in the
 * agent — the chat pauses for an explicit human yes before any of them runs.
 * This layer stays thin on purpose: the approval gate lives in the tool
 * definitions and the reversibility guarantee (ENABLED/PAUSED only, no
 * archive) lives in the ad-client, so there is no policy here to bypass.
