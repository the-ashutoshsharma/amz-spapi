/**
 * What the ads report sync has fetched, and what it is waiting on (#145).
 *
 * Two jobs, and both are the reason this is stored rather than derived:
 *
 * **1. A failed sync must not read as "you had no ads activity".** Downstream,
 * the harvest's coverage gate sees only whether rows exist for a window. Absent
 * rows because Amazon rate-limited us and absent rows because the seller ran no
 * ads are indistinguishable in the data itself — and the first is a bug to fix
 * while the second is a fact to report. The run record is what tells them
 * apart, and it is what the staleness line on the AdOps screen reads.
 *
 * **2. Window ownership, so an upload cannot double-count.** Row identity is
 * built from the RAW header names and cell values (`rowIdFor` in
 * report-ingest), which is deliberate — it means a change to our own
 * normalisation cannot re-import history. The consequence is that the same
 * data from two sources does not collide: the console export says
 * `customersearchterm` and `$278.25`, the API says `searchTerm` and `278.25`,
 * so dedup never fires and every row lands twice. A seller who uploads the
 * July export while this sync also holds July would see double the spend, with
 * both figures looking entirely plausible. Recording which windows the sync
 * owns lets the upload path say so instead of silently merging.
 *
 * Keyed on the ADVERTISER PROFILE, not the seller: ads profiles are their own
 * accounts (this seller has four — BR, US, MX, CA), they fail independently,
 * and one profile's rate limit must not look like another's outage.
